Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other

Note - we can use a hash table to map the sorted version of a word to a list of its anagrams

example:

sortAnagrams('acre race care act cat tac') =>

{
  acre : {acre, race, care},
  act: {act, cat, tac},
}
Once all the words have been grouped into lists by anagram we can put them back into the array.

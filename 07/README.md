This application contains a function 'list' which will determine if a linked list is circular. It takes in one parameter, which should be a singularly linked list. 

If the input is not an object the function will throw an error.

If the input is a circular list it will return true. If the input is not circular the function will return false. 

The tests for the function are as follows: 
    1. Expects the function to return false if the sll is not circular
    2. Expects the function to return true if the sll is circular
    3. Expects the function to throw an error if the input is not an object.
